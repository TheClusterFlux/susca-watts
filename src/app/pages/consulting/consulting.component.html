                    <h3>How long does it take to obtain Accreditation?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Once we submit your application and supporting documents it can take anything from 3 months to 2 years. The timeline depends on whether your application and supporting documents meet the requirements, and WHERE you submit your application to.</p>

                    <h3>How expensive is Accreditation?</h3>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>It all depends on what you have in place, the more you have in place the better. In other words, the more you do, the cheaper it is.</p>
                        <p>If you do this by yourself, it could also cost you your time (could take months/years, depending on what you have/don't have & how many mistakes you make).</p>
                        <p>Before asking for assistance you must know what qualifications you want to offer. Always keep in mind, To be an accredited provider is expensive - quality learning, high standards, and subject matter experts, assessors and moderators have never been cheap.</p>
