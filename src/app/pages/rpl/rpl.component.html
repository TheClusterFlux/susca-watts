            <h2>What is RPL?</h2>
            <p>The Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a process which allows a person who has formal, non-formal and informal learning to be measured, mediated for recognition across different contexts and certified against the requirements for credit, access, inclusion or advancement in the formal education and training system or workplace.</p>

            <h2>What is the Aim of RPL?</h2>
            <p>The aim is to make it possible to obtain formal recognition for skills and knowledge gained throughout life, such as in workplaces, self-study, in-house training and development, formal education and training or experiences. The RPL process also includes providing guidance and support to a candidate from managers, mentors, coaches, facilitators and assessors, to ensure that knowledge is discovered and displayed in terms of a relevant qualification registered on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF).</p>
            <p>The above methods of gaining knowledge and skills was previously not accepted as a formal route of awarding national qualifications, but with the new system it is encourage as employees who has been in a certain job for years without formal recognition, can through an RPL assessment where experience is measured against a qualification, be awarded formal recognition as a national qualification allocated to that career or job profile.</p>
            <p>It should however be noted that a candidate who wishes to undertake an assessment against national standards should make him or herself familiar with the specific criteria and evidence required.</p>
